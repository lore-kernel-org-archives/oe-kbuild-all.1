I think there might be a misunderstanding about the level of abstraction
at which the blocker tracking operates.

The blocker tracking mechanism operates on pointers to higher-level
locks (like struct mutex), as that is what is stored in the
task_struct->blocker field. It does not operate on the lower-level
arch_spinlock_t inside it.

While we could track the internal arch_spinlock_t, that would break
encapsulation. The hung task detector should remain generic and not
depend on lock-specific implementation details ;)

Completely agreed that correctness and portability are the goals.

Please, feel free to send a patch.
