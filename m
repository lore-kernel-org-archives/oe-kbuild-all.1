By "root directory", do you mean kernel sources root directory or build 
output root directory ?

How ? I figure that tools/testing/selftests/lib.mk overrides 
KHDR_INCLUDES if it is not defined yet:

ifeq ($(KHDR_INCLUDES),)
KHDR_INCLUDES := -isystem $(top_srcdir)/usr/include
endif

and selftests makefiles include ../lib.mk.

This KHDR_INCLUDES can be modified by O=... when built from the kernel 
top level, thus using tools/testing/selftests/Makefile:

ifneq ($(KBUILD_OUTPUT),)
[...]
   KHDR_INCLUDES := -isystem ${abs_objtree}/usr/include
else
[...]
   KHDR_INCLUDES := -isystem ${abs_srctree}/usr/include
endif

But it's up to the individual selftests to actually use 
$(KHDR_INCLUDES). In many cases, they hardcode 
-I../../../../usr/include/ which is bogus when the build root (O=...) 
differs from the source root.

  If this test is being

The headers were previously built by "make O=/tmp/kselftest headers", as 
it should, it's just that the selftest makefile uses a hardcoded path 
that is relative to the source directory, and it appears that this 
pattern is repeated all across the selftests.

In an ideal world, we'd have a way to _remove_ the build environment 
kernel headers from the include search paths, because this is a problem 
for reproducibility of the tests.
