The above is a list of the questions you need to investigate.
(Note, it takes several minutes on elixir.bootlin.com to check
 some of this, but I'm not the author of the code)

The IRQ is usually provided by Device Tree or ACPI (here is DT only case).
Then the platform code converts that to resource which this driver consumes.
That resource is used when instantiating GPIO (IRQ) chip.

I don't know. The commit message of your change should elaborate this.

> Please tell me the relationship between these questions and my patch.

The tight relationship. The patch changes the flow. Either
you shouldn't do that, or be aware and explain why it's not
a problem. Or get it done differently.
