    31	 * udelay - Inserting a delay based on microseconds with busy waiting
    32	 * @usec:	requested delay in microseconds
    33	 *
    34	 * When delaying in an atomic context ndelay(), udelay() and mdelay() are the
    35	 * only valid variants of delaying/sleeping to go with.
    36	 *
    37	 * When inserting delays in non atomic context which are shorter than the time
    38	 * which is required to queue e.g. an hrtimer and to enter then the scheduler,
    39	 * it is also valuable to use udelay(). But is not simple to specify a generic
    40	 * threshold for this which will fit for all systems, but an approximation would
    41	 * be a threshold for all delays up to 10 microseconds.
    42	 *
    43	 * When having a delay which is larger than the architecture specific
    44	 * %MAX_UDELAY_MS value, please make sure mdelay() is used. Otherwise a overflow
    45	 * risk is given.
    46	 *
    47	 * Please note that ndelay(), udelay() and mdelay() may return early for several
    48	 * reasons (https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2011/01/09/56):
    49	 *
    50	 * #. computed loops_per_jiffy too low (due to the time taken to execute the
    51	 *    timer interrupt.)
