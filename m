But we're no longer using it in the same way as BUILD_BUG_ON.

I looked through a lot of the cases where BUILD_BUG_ON is used. All of
them seem to be checking that some constants are equal to something,
different from something, less than something, etc. It compares #defined
constants, and stuff like sizeof(struct) and such. But I could not find
even a single example where BUILD_BUG_ON used for bounds-checking a
runtime value, which is the use-case I think is problematic.

If there's no reference, function boundary, or non-constant value, then
I don't think it's problematic. The problem IMO is using build_error for
bounds checking runtime values.
