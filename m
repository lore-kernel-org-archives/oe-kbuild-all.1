Heh, thanks for the high praise but I do not maintain or help with this
service. I am focused on maintaining the LLVM build support in the
kernel and our list is CC'd on reports that use clang so we can help
with issues that appear only with clang (such as this one). Sorry I was
unable to jump in sooner.

This sounds like good feedback for the LKP folks. I have my own wrapper
and processes for reproducing these issues because I do it a lot so I am
unaware of the potential jagged edges with the reproducers. They are
usually pretty responsive to requests/reports of problems with their
stuff in my experience.

Cheers,
Nathan
