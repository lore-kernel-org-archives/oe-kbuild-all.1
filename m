Would it be possible to still send the report, but to inject a line to
the report stating it is marked as low confidence due to X and Y
(unreleased compiler etc.)?

I think it is still valuable to get the reports, but it would be nice to
know we don't need to scramble all hands on deck immediately.

I guess one could also just read the report more carefully to learn
that an unreleased compiler was used. But seeing this at a glance would
be great.
