I don't think it is like that at all. We rely on non-guaranteed behavior
for data races because we have no choice and we had extensive discussion
about it with the compiler folks who are comfortable with us using that
particular exception.

The difference is that someone adding unsafe to avoid a bounds check
screams to the reviewers that something sketchy is going on. In
comparison, drivers calling `Bounded::from_expr(_)` with a non-trivial
expression looks like entirely normal code even though it might be
relying on the precise and definitely subject-to-change details of when
LLVM is choosing to inline various functions.

If const eval / generics / macros are too painful, then perform a
runtime bounds check just like everyone who uses Rust outside of the
kernel is doing.

I do not at all think it's obvious that upstream would be happy about
this, considering it comes with the serious trade-off of us relying on
these optimizations happening.
