   216	 * A facility to provide lazy MMU batching.  This allows PTE updates and
   217	 * page invalidations to be delayed until a call to leave lazy MMU mode
   218	 * is issued.  Some architectures may benefit from doing this, and it is
   219	 * beneficial for both shadow and direct mode hypervisors, which may batch
   220	 * the PTE updates which happen during this window.  Note that using this
   221	 * interface requires that read hazards be removed from the code.  A read
   222	 * hazard could result in the direct mode hypervisor case, since the actual
   223	 * write to the page tables may not yet have taken place, so reads though
   224	 * a raw PTE pointer after it has been modified are not guaranteed to be
   225	 * up to date.
   226	 *
   227	 * In the general case, no lock is guaranteed to be held between entry and exit
   228	 * of the lazy mode. So the implementation must assume preemption may be enabled
   229	 * and cpu migration is possible; it must take steps to be robust against this.
   230	 * (In practice, for user PTE updates, the appropriate page table lock(s) are
   231	 * held, but for kernel PTE updates, no lock is held). Nesting is not permitted
   232	 * and the mode cannot be used in interrupt context.
