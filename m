These errors have been there for long time.

In the current linus's tree, as long as CONFIG_PCI is disabled, these
errors can be seen. I don't know why they are reported on my patches
utill now.

You can see in arch/s390/pci/pci.c, ioremap_xx() and iounmap are all
defined there. Only enabling CONFIG_PCI can build and link in pci.o.
Otherwise, all those drivers calling ioremap(), devm_ioremap(), their
variants or wrappers will fail building and trigger errors like this
report. It's not related to my patch. LKP test robot may need provide
a clean base to test posted patches to avoid confusion.

arch/s390/pci/pci.c:
==================
obj-$(CONFIG_PCI)       += pci.o pci_irq.o pci_dma.o pci_clp.o pci_sysfs.o \
                           pci_event.o pci_debug.o pci_insn.o pci_mmio.o \
                           pci_bus.o pci_kvm_hook.o
