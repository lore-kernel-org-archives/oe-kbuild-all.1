also, this should be return false

for (j =3D 0; j < BPF_REG_SIZE; j++) got lost during rebasing, sigh. I
have a test that's testing this exact condition to be checked
properly, and it is passing (that is proper return false is returned
here) consistently with the garbage value of j :(

Anyways, restored for loop here.
