I don't think so,

RFC6951 has:

6.1.  Get or Set the Remote UDP Encapsulation Port Number
      (SCTP_REMOTE_UDP_ENCAPS_PORT)
...
   sue_assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style
      sockets.  For one-to-many style sockets, the application may fill
      in an association identifier or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC for this query.
      It is an error to use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC in sue_assoc_id.

   sue_address:  This specifies which address is of interest.  If a
      wildcard address is provided, it applies only to future paths.

So I'm not seeing a reason to have a system wide knob that takes
effect in run time like this.
Enable, start apps, and they keep behaving as initially configured.
Need to disable? Restart the apps/sockets.

Thoughts?
