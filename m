GAS's error message is a little more informative as to what is going on.

/tmp/cccn02Dg.s: Assembler messages:

which leads to looking at the config:

$ rg 'CPU_(V|32)|THUMB2' .config
265:CONFIG_CPU_V7M=y
268:CONFIG_CPU_32v7M=y
273:CONFIG_CPU_V7M_NUM_IRQ=90
311:CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL=y

CONFIG_GENERIC_ATOMIC64 is selected for CONFIG_CPU_V7M, presumably to
avoid using these instructions, based on the other CONFIGs in that
select statement in arch/arm/Kconfig? I am not sure how the test needs
to cope with that but hopefully that makes it a little more obvious what
is happening here.

Cheers,
Nathan
