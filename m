Urrgh, computed gotos :-(

So, if my heat-addled brain isn't completely gone, then this all boils
down to something like:

  drm_exec_init(&exec);
label:
  for (;drm_exec_cleanup(&exec);) {
     ...
     if (unlikely(drm_exec_is_contended(&exec)))
       goto label;
     ...
  }
  ...
  drm_exec_fini(&exec);

Except, you've laundered that label through a computed goto to allow
multiple such constructs in a single function -- because can't have
multiple identical labels etc.

And then clang, can't untangle the web and makes a mess of it. Which is
really rather unfortunate, because indirect calls are yuck -- also
retpolines and cfi and all that jazz.

I do think this is very much a compiler issue, clang should never emit
an indirect call for this. Doing that is just aweful.

Also, note that if anybody were ever to use a guard() inside this
drm_exec_until_all_locked() construct, there is no guarantee the
computed goto will actually trip the __cleanup(). Computed goto's and
scope do not play well together. And the moment clang emits an indirect
call, it means it lost track of things and things *will* go sideways.

And the only reason you want that label, is because nested loops,
because without that, a simple 'continue' would do just fine.

That is, I think this drm_exec_until_all_locked() thing has some
fundamental problems the moment clang fails to optimize it away.
Correctness really depends on the compiler not actually ever doing a
computed goto.

Right.

It is also the first to cause clang to loose its mind and emit an
indirect call. Which as I've explained above, really is a problem.

While I do think we could teach objtool about this, I also think it
should still emit a warning, because as stated, this pattern is very
very suspect and likely broken :-(
